# Soaring Bot - JDA Version

Soaring Bot is a discord bot coded in java using the JDA libaries, 
documentation on how to use the bot will be added in the future.

Currently this bot is still being transferd from our old Python version of Soaring Bot. Keep in mind that when adding this bot to your own server it might show up offline till it is moved back to the cloud.
